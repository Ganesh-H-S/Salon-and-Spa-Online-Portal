# Curlz-Salon-And-Spa
Web Technology Lab Mini Project

A Salon and Spa management website used to make bookings for the requested services. While commonly employed with much greater complexity, the system presented currently is a basic model of appointment Reservation System. The main focus of the system is on the application of web technologies to develop a suitable web application. The user is able to access the system only after registering. The system will throw suitable warnings for cases such as invalid access, invalid retrieval and invalid checks. The user names and passwords are stored separately, and a common panel holds the item overviews, which can be accessed separately, with separate storage for them as well as for placing any orders. When dealing with several transactions of several users, a structured and organized approach of the Reservation Management System is effective and user-friendly.
